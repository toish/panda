Panda Key Exchange uses the Diffie-Hellman key exchange to generate a common passcode between two computers over a unsecured network.

## Installing
You'll need to compile panda from source, but don't worry, it ain't that hard.

### You'll need:
- GHC compiler
- Cabal
- Something that can run the Haskell Platform [Linux, Windows, OSX, etc]

### Compiling (The Cabal way)
1. Clone the repo
2. cd into repo
3. `cabal update`
4. `cabal configure`
5. `cabal install`
6. You should be able to use panda as a command!

## How to use
Panda works by using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which means you'll have to move the actual keys around yourself, but panda will generate them for you.

```shell
panda gen -n 202
```
Will generate a key, with a secret number of 202. This secret number should be much more random than this.

```shell
panda make -p PANDAKEY:8009-10007:5 -s PANDASECRET:31a3b
```
Will generate the result, p should be someone elses public key, and s should be your secret key.

2.  | `panda gen ... -j`                      | Same as 1, but output in JSON format
3.  | `panda gen ... -p`                      | Same as 1, but only outputs public key (can be used with 2 or 5)
4.  | `panda gen ... -s`                      | Same as 1, but only outputs private key (can be used with 2 or 5)

6.  | `panda gen ... --prime=primeNumber`     | Same as 1, generates with a non-standard prime number (can be used with anything)
7.  | `panda gen ... --root=primitiveRoot`    | Same as 1, generates with a non-standard primitive root (can be used with 3 or 4)
8.  | `panda make -p publicKey -s privateKey` | Calculates the common key between someone elses public key, and your private key
9.  | `panda make ... -q`                     | Same as 6, but outputs in quiet mode
10. | `panda make ... -j`                     | Same as 6, but outputs in JSON format
